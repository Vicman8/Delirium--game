# SER225 RPG Game

## What is this?
This is Medievirium, a 2d pixelated RPG game that takes place on the Quinnipiac University campus, Its the hottest day ever recorded, all of the ac parts around campus are destroyed giving the player no form of cooling, you start to suffer from heat exhaustion, You play as a history buff named Kaegen, you can travel through into this portal hallucinating a whole other world themed around Medieval times, and must go through different puzzles and interact with different characters to help you collect all the AC parts needed and to fight what has caused the disturbance to the AC unit.   

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.
